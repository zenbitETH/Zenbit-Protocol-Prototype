# Zenbit-Protocol-Prototype

[Zenbit](http://zenbit.city/) is a protocol that reward users with NFTs and $ZNBT when they develop digital skills in urban or virtual enviroments. 

# Intro

Technology and financial gaps are the main obstacles that people worldwide face to access to the digital economy. In Mexico, 34% of the total population doesn’t have internet access and 60% don’t have a bank account. Even though infrastructure availability raises some obstacles on people to be part of the economy digitalization, the real gap is revealed by official figures which indicate that near to 80% of people living in urban areas with internet access doesn’t participate in the digital economy due to a lack of digital skills.

Zenbit protocol wants to tokenize the value of digital skills, creative assets, and urban governance participation, a prototype is being tested on Mexican urbanized zones with internet access, where users can interact with Zenbit’s Hub through a web navigator to complete tasks and gain economic value on tokens rewards or digital skills certificates on non-fungible tokens.

The protocol has the purpose of establishing people’s digital skills, creative value, and citizenship as determining elements of access to financial services and jobs. We are looking to reach worldwide where people are facing similar challenges to boost their digital economy and where Zenbit protocol can help to close the digital gaps.
