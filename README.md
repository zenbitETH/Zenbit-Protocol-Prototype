# Zenbit Protocol Prototype

[Zenbit](http://zenbit.city/) is a protocol for blockchain cities that rewards its users with NFTs and $ ZNBT for using and developing digital skills in urban or virtual environments.

# Intro

Technology and financial gaps are the main obstacles that people worldwide face to access to the digital economy. In Mexico, 34% of the total population doesn’t have internet access and 60% don’t have a bank account. Even though infrastructure availability raises some obstacles on people to be part of the economy digitalization, the real gap is revealed by official figures which indicate that near to 80% of people living in urban areas with internet access doesn’t participate in the digital economy due to a lack of digital skills.

Zenbit is a set of smart contracts for tokenizing the value of digital skills, creative assets, and urban governance participation. Users can interact with the protocol contracts on https://zenbit.city through a decentralized wallet integrated into their web browser. By completing tasks in which they use or develop their digital skills, users are rewarded with units of the $ ZNTB token and a collectible token (NFTs) that certifies the skill obtained during the task.

The protocol is intended to boost both financial and digital inclusion by encouraging technological specialization, the production of creative value, and citizen participation; establishing them as determining elements in the access to decentralized financial services and digital job opportunities.
